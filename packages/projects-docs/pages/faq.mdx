      ## Which languages and frameworks are supported?

[Cloud Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox) and [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview) work with anything that can run in Docker. They provide the best experience for JavaScript (including TypeScript), frontend and full-stack, and officially support (with built-in LSP/IntelliSense) Rust, Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Node and Deno (more languages coming soon).

[Browser sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview) are more limited. They support JavaScript/TypeScript projects, as well as Node.js.

[Create a sandbox from a template](https://codesandbox.io/s/), or read more
about the
[difference between browser and cloud sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/editors).

## How do I make a sandbox private?

There are several ways to set a sandbox as private. One universal way (that works both for browser sandboxes and cloud sandboxes) is to right-click a sandbox from the dashboard and select _Make sandbox private_.

<Callout>
A [Pro subscription](https://codesandbox.io/pricing) is required to
make sandboxes private or unlisted.
</Callout>

You can also change the privacy settings from the editor. How you do it will depend on whether you're using a browser sandbox or a cloud sandbox, as shown below.

### Make a browser sandbox private

The browser editor provides two ways to change the privacy:

1. Change the privacy drop-down under _Permissions_ in the _Sandbox Info_ tab.
2. Click the _Share_ button on the top right and change the privacy drop-down at the top.

### Make a cloud sandbox private

The cloud editor also provides two ways to change the privacy:

1. Click the chevron on the right side of your sandbox's name at the top of the screen; click _Edit info_ and then change the drop-down next to _Privacy_.
2. Click the _Share_ button on the top right and change the drop-down under _Permissions_.

## I'm getting a 422 error when importing from GitHub, why?

There are a few possible reasons a repo might throw that error on import. The
most common are the lack of a `package.json` file, or the project using
more than 500 modules (files).

If you think it's something else, or you're unable to solve this yourself, then [get in touch](mailto:support@codesandbox.io)
and provide a link to the repo you're importing and we can look into this for
you.

## Why are my start scripts not having an effect?

For performance reasons, we ignore any specified scripts in browser sandboxes,
instead using a default script. If you need to control the scripts, then we
recommend using a [cloud sandbox](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox).

## Can I change the Node version used in a sandbox?

Yes, for cloud sandboxes you can refer to [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/vm#configuring-nodejs-version) to learn how to change the Node version. All recent server sandboxes run in a cloud sandbox.

For container sandboxes that are created after May 10 2021 we run Node v14.18.1 (LTS) by default.
For backwards compatibility, the older sandboxes are on Node v10. However, you can
specify a `node` value to alter the version in `sandbox.config.json`, which will
be used instead. For further details, see [configuration](/learn/sandboxes/configuration).

Note that we recommend to use Cloud Sandboxes in

## Can I open the terminal, console, or test panel instead of the browser in a browser sandbox?

Yes. The terminal, console, and problems tabs are all draggable. Click on the
tab and drag it to the bar alongside browser and tests. You can then
re-order those items by dragging them in that bar. Whichever is first from left to
right in the list of tabs is what opens first when other folks view the sandbox.
The ordering is maintained within the sandbox. You can also achieve this change
by setting a value for "view" in a
[sandbox config file](/configuration#sandbox-configuration).

## How do I change the font used in the browser editor?

Ensure the font you want to use has been installed on your computer, then put
the name of it first in the comma-separated list under 'Editor: Font Family'
from File > Preferences > Settings in the editor.

<Callout>
Changing fonts is currently only supported in [browser sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview).
</Callout>

## Do sandboxes have any limitations?

We currently provide [Browser Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview#what-is-a-browser-sandbox) and [Cloud Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox). Browser Sandboxes have the following limitations:

- The maximum file upload size is 7MB for Free users and 30MB for Pro users.
- Imported sandboxes must contain a `package.json` file.
- Cannot use more than 500 modules (files). Note that
  `node_modules` and dependencies do not count toward this limit.
- The maximum file size that can be opened in the editor is 2MB. Files uploaded
  that are larger than that still exist but are linked as a static assets.
- Terminal commands that alter the filesystem of the container instance aren't
  synced with files shown in the editor. You'll need to refresh to see files
  updated this way.
- When using a container, there is a sync limit of 10 files per second and only
  files up to 2MB are synced with the editor. Files larger than that still exist
  but are not shown in the editor's file tree. You're still able to write and
  read to and from them in your code and they can be seen and edited via the
  terminal.
- When using a container, the sandbox sleeps after around 10 minutes and can be woken by opening
  the sandbox or preview in a web browser.
- When using a container, the sandbox has a 1GB persistent storage limit, a 1GB vCPU soft
  limit, and a hard memory limit of 2GB.
  
Cloud Sandboxes are part of our evolved CodeSandbox experience, so we highly advise you to use them to avoid encountering these limitations.

## I'm getting a 'Request Entity too Large' error, what should I do?

If you encounter this error when importing or committing, check your sandbox or
repo for large binary files and remove them.

## Can I use a database on CodeSandbox?

Yes, you can use any database that has a Docker image available. Some popular databases with Docker images include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

For ready-to-use examples, check the _Database_ tab of our [starter templates](https://codesandbox.io/s/) modal.

### Do I need to install Docker on my local machine to use it in CodeSandbox?

No, you don't need to install Docker on your local machine. CodeSandbox has [built-in support for Docker](https://codesandbox.io/blog/introducing-docker-support-in-codesandbox), so you can use it directly in the online development environment.

### How do I access the database once it's running in a Docker container?

You can access the database using the appropriate driver for your language or framework. Typically, you'll need to provide the hostname, port number, username, and password to connect to the database.

### Can I use multiple databases in the same CodeSandbox project?

Yes, you can use multiple databases in the same project by running multiple Docker containers with different port numbers. However, keep in mind that running multiple databases can put a strain on your system resources and affect performance.

### Can I use Docker Compose in CodeSandbox?

Yes, you can use Docker Compose in CodeSandbox to orchestrate multiple containers and define the relationships between them. However, you'll need to create a Docker Compose file and run the `docker-compose` command in the terminal to start the containers.

### Is it safe to use a database in CodeSandbox with Docker support?

Yes, it's safe to use a database in CodeSandbox with Docker support, as long as you follow best practices for security and keep your database credentials private. Docker provides a secure and isolated environment for running containers, so your database is protected from external threats.

### How do I troubleshoot issues with my database in CodeSandbox with Docker support?

If you're having issues with your database, you can check the logs of the container to see if there are any error messages. You can also run commands like `docker ps` and `docker logs` in the terminal to get more information about the container. Additionally, you can ask for help on the CodeSandbox community forums or consult the documentation of the specific database you're using.

## How do I change the editor's theme?

To change the [theme of a Cloud Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/themes), click on the CodeSandbox logo at the top left, then go to Settings >  Preferences, and select a theme from the Themes dropdown. You can also do it from the [command palette](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/commandpalette).

On a Browser Sandbox, you can change the theme from File > Preferences > Color Theme in the editor. You can also set a custom VS Code theme on a Browser Sandbox. Open VS Code, Press (CMD or CTRL) +
SHIFT + P, Enter: '> Developer: Generate Color Scheme From Current Settings',
copy the contents and paste it into Preferences > Appearance from the top-right
avatar menu. After completing that, you need to reload the browser and select
"Custom" as your color theme from File > Preferences > Color Theme.

## Why is my code in an infinite loop that doesn't allow me to edit?

While we do have infinite loop protection as a
[configurable option](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/sandboxes/configuration) it doesn't
prevent all scenarios where infinite loops can occur, such as with incomplete
code. When this happens, you can append `runonclick=1` to the editor URL to stop
the code from being automatically executed, enabling you to edit your code to
resolve it. For example:
[https://codesandbox.io/s/new?runonclick=1](https://codesandbox.io/s/new?runonclick=1)

## How do I cancel my Personal Pro, Team Pro or Patron plan?

For Team Pro & Personal Pro users, once you've logged in, you can downgrade your plan on the
[Settings page](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/settings). 

If you're on one of our legacy Patron plans you can cancel
your subscription on the [Patron page](https://codesandbox.io/patron).

       ## What to do about that recurring trust modal?

![Trust Modal](./learn/images/vscode-trust.jpg)

This modal shows up every time you launch a project folder in a new container. Since every branch will be opened with a unique SSH URL, VS Code will ask you to verify that you trust the connection. This is an important security notice to ensure that the user understands the connection being established before opening the code. You can read more about the modal on the [VS Code blog](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/07/06/workspace-trust).

## Do I have to be connected to a live session on CodeSandbox to work on a branch?

It is possible to work in an “un-synced” state. For CodeSandbox features to work, the branch needs to be established on a remote connection **and** connected to Pitcher (learn [how it works](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-vscode#how-it-works)).

## Who can access my code?

Only people on your CodeSandbox team with permissions to the repository may join as collaborators. Repository permissions are carried over from GitHub.

To add someone new to the team, provide access on GitHub and add them to your CodeSandbox team. From there, they can access the code in the browser or follow the steps above to use VS Code.

## Is it possible to use GitHub Copilot together with CodeSandbox?

Yes. Follow the steps below:

1. Use our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects) to connect to one of our Cloud Sandboxes or Repositories.
2. Install the Copilot VS Code extension (if not already installed).
3. Configure the extension to run in CodeSandbox remote connections (following the instructions for [Default User Extensions](/learn/repositories/editors#default-user-extensions)).

       ## Sandboxes

### Why am I getting a git error resolving a dependency?
CodeSandbox for iOS is only compatible with dependencies hosted and accessible via HTTP or HTTPS.

This happens because the app doesn't provide local shell environments where you can run arbitrary commands, like git. Use the [CodeSandbox web editor](/learn/sandboxes/editors) instead.

You may find some of the following answers helpful if you have gone through the sections in this documentation but still haven’t solved your questions:
    
### I'm getting an error trying to run my sandbox in CodeSandbox for iOS. What could be the cause?

The root cause of the problem could be either a coding mistake on your side or a dependency trying to do something forbidden by iOS.

For instance, dependencies relying on WebAssembly won't work, as WebAssembly requires JIT compilation to function, and this isn't allowed by the App Store guidelines.

Another cause can be that your project or one of its dependencies rely on a native dependency or Node extension, which aren’t supported.

### One of the scripts in my sandbox cannot be run. What could be the cause?

Only the scripts that start with `node` or the name of a dependency located inside the `node_modules/.bin` directory are compatible. This happens because CodeSandbox for iOS doesn’t provide a shell environment, so scripts containing an arbitrary bash command won't work.

### I can't see the preview of my sandbox in the web browser. What could be the cause?

The runtime provides a `WEB_PORT` environment variable matching the port used by default by the in-app web browser. If your sandbox doesn't use the port in that environment variable, then you will need to fix the URL in the web browser to load the page on the right port.

### Why does my sandbox stop running when I move the app to the background?
This happens because iOS suspends the process while the application is in the background, which also suspends all its activity.

### My sandbox requires Node.js 14 but the app uses Node.js 12. How can I change the Node.js version?
The application uses a Node.js port that hasn’t been upgraded to Node.js 14 as we have been focused on integrating the new CodeSandbox experience instead. Stay tuned, as we will be making some updates.

## Repositories

### Why can't I make any changes to my project?
You likely have a protected branch selected (i.e. `main`). Forking a branch will create a new one where you can make changes.
