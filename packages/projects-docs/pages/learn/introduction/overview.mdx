CodeSandbox is a cloud development environment that makes it easy for you to spin up a development environment in the cloud and start working on it, whether it's a small prototype or a big monolith with multiple services.

For prototyping we recommend to use [sandboxes](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/sandboxes/overview), for cloud development with a strong GitHub integration we recommend to use [repositories](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/overview).

## Editors

We provider many alternatives for you to code. Each option is built to help you focus on what matters: getting the work done without friction.

## Browser Sandbox Editor

Known and loved for years, this online editor is built for rapid web development. Use this editor to prototype quickly, experiment easily, and share creations with a click.

## Cloud Web Editor

Our new web editor is part of a larger effort at CodeSandbox to increase the accessibility of complex tools like git, setup, review flows, contributions, and visualizing components.

## Keep working on VS Code

**Install the CodeSandbox Projects VS Code extension and open any branch or cloud sandbox directly in your VS Code editor.** Work from your local environment with your own configurations and shortcuts whilst remaining connected to the CodeSandbox development environment.

## Opening a branch in VS Code

![Open in vscode button](../images/getting-openvscode.jpg)

To start working in a branch on VS Code, open the branch in the Editor and click on the `Open in VS Code` button positioned in the bottom left corner. This will prompt you to install the CodeSandbox extension responsible for making the connection to our cloud development environment.
