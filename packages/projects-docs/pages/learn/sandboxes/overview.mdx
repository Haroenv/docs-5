# CodeSandbox Sandboxes

Sandboxes are the ideal environment for rapid web development. CodeSandbox provides two types of sandboxes: cloud sandboxes (which run in a microVM) and browser sandboxes (which run using browser resources).

To create a new sandbox, you can clone a template from our ["Create Sandbox"](https://codesandbox.io/s) modal. When clicking on a template, we create a fork (a copy) of the template and open the newly created sandbox in our web editor.

By default, we recommend using cloud sandboxes, which provide all the tooling needed for building prototypes. Browser sandboxes are mostly useful as a playground for basic front-end JavaScript projects.

## Difference between Cloud & Browser Sandboxes

## What is a Cloud Sandbox?
Unlike Browser Sandboxes that run on your browser, Cloud Sandboxes run on our [microVMs](/learn/environment/vm).

       Cloud Sandboxes are great for prototyping any type of project. They can run both backend and front-end services.
       You can learn more about the editor and the unique functionalities of the cloud developer environment in [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

       Like Browser Sandboxes, Cloud Sandboxes are free to use.

       Cloud Sandboxes run on microVMs, which brings two features that make them great for prototyping:

       1. Fast cloning. You can fork a sandbox [within 2 seconds](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds) and continue with an exact clone of the microVM. This way, you can quickly test multiple approaches to your prototype.
       2. Instant resume. When you connect to a Cloud Sandbox, it will wake up within 1 second and continue with your running dev server. This way, you can quickly continue prototyping.

       Cloud Sandboxes and Repositories run on the same infrastructure and use the same editor. The main distinction between the two is that Sandboxes are built for prototyping while Repositories are built for full-scale development. Once you scale a Sandbox to a Repository, you will have:
       - Branching
       - Git tooling
       - Full integration with GitHub

       To configure a Cloud Sandbox, you can read more about [tasks](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/task) and [Docker](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/docker).

    ## What is a Browser Sandbox?
      When using Browser Sandboxes, your code is evaluated and run in our built-in
execution environment. These client environments run entirely inside of your browser and will continue to
bundle your code even when you lose your connection to our servers.

Browser Sandboxes each have their own bundler attached to them which is
configured to support a specific framework and emulate their official CLI tools.
They are not one-to-one implementations and thus do not support advanced
configuration like custom webpack configurations or ejecting. However, they are
designed to mirror the default behavior of the framework.

If your project requires the use of a terminal or any additional advanced configuration like Docker, you can use a [Cloud Sandbox](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud) instead.
