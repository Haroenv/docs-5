# CodeSandbox Sandboxes

Sandboxes are the environment for rapid web development. CodeSandbox has two types of sandboxes, browser sandboxes (which run in the browser) and cloud sandboxes (which run in a microVM).

To create a new sandbox, you can clone a template from our ["Create Sandbox"](https://codesandbox.io/s) modal. When clicking on a template, we create a fork (a copy) of the template and open the newly created sandbox in our web editor.

    ## What is a Browser Sandbox?
      When using Browser Sandboxes, your code is evaluated and run in our built-in
execution environment. These client environments run entirely inside of your browser and will continue to
bundle your code even when you lose your connection to our servers.

Browser Sandboxes each have their own bundler attached to them which are
configured to support a specific framework and emulate their official CLI tools.
They are not one-to-one implementations and thus do not support advanced
configuration like custom webpack configurations or ejecting. However, they are
designed to mirror the default behavior of the framework.

If your project requires the use of a terminal or any additional advanced configuration like Docker, you can use a [Cloud Sandbox](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud) instead.

## What is a Cloud Sandbox?
Unlike Browser Sandboxes that run on your browser, Cloud Sandboxes run on our [microVMs](/learn/environment/vm).

       Cloud Sandboxes are great for any prototyping needs and are suitable for any type of project. They can run both backend and frontend services.
       You can learn more about the editor and the unique functionalities of the cloud developer environment in [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

       Like Browser Sandboxes, Cloud Sandboxes are free to use.

       Cloud Sandboxes run on microVMs, which brings two features that make them great for prototyping:

       1. Fast cloning. You can fork a sandbox [within 2 seconds](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds) and continue with an exact clone of the microVM. This way, you can quickly test multiple approaches to your prototype.
       2. Instant resume. When you connect to a Cloud Sandbox, it will wake up within 1 second and continue with your running dev server. This way, you can quickly continue prototyping.

       Cloud Sandboxes and Repositories run on the same infrastructure and use the same editor. The main distinction between the two is that Sandboxes are built for prototyping while Repositories are built for full-scale development. Once you scale a Sandbox to a Repository, you will have:
       - Branching
       - Git tooling
       - Full integration with GitHub

       To configure a Cloud Sandbox, you can read more about it [tasks](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/task) and [Docker](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/docker).
